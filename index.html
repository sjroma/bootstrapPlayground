		<p>My first four weeks at <a href="https://www.theironyard.com" target="_blank">The Iron Yard</a> consisted of using HTML, CSS and Javascript for Front End Development. I was having problems grasping the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes" target="_blank">Flexbox</a> concept. I talked with a couple of front-end developers I knew and they each said basically the same thing.  They didn't know what I was talking about because they used Bootstrap. I understood what the instructors were trying to do by teaching HTML and CSS...learn the basics and the rest will be easier to understand.</p>
		<p>Recently I did a project that incorporated Bootstrap. When I first typed in the link to a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to pull in Bootstrap I was pleasantly surprised at the results. I put together some pages that helped me see what some of the different parts of Bootstrap looked like. Then I tried putting it all together. This is just some of the things I've been trying with Bootstrap. They're not pretty or sexy...they're for me to try things out.</p>
		<p>At this time, Bootstrap v4 is still in beta so these pages all incorporate v3.3.7.</p>
		<p>I have not installed Bootstrap on my box. Each of the pages has a CDN call.</p>
