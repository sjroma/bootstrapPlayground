# bootstrapPlayground
* This is just a place for me to store some Bootstrap pages I created/played with.
   I worked on a project that used some Bootstrap styling rather than the CSS that I used frequently while attending The Iron Yard.  I was more than impressed at how much faster things could be styled using Bootstrap but knowing the basics of CSS helped me to understand how Bootstrap works.  
   There are no lessons or anything here, just code I wanted to keep as a reference for myself.  If I play more I'll add those pages too just so they don't get lost.  
   I did a page that has accordians using just HTML and JavaScript.  That will more than likely be the next thing I do with Bootstrap.  (Google is my friend.) 

**Notes:**
* I originally created these pages on a Mac running OSX El Capitan (version 10.11.6)
    I checked the pages using;
         * Chrome (version 62.0.3202.94)
         * Firefox (version 57.0)
         * Safari (version 11.0.1)
      
   I don't have a Windoze box handy but I may put these pages on a flash drive so I can see how they look with Exploder.  I don't anticipate any probs.
