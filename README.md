# Roma's Bootstrap Sandbox

This is my sandbox for playing with, and discovering, Bootstrap. Feel free to do the same. Add pages, code something so you can see what it looks like. This is not meant to be instructional since everything here can be found by simply [Googling](https://google.com "Google is your friend") whatever you're looking for or going to one of the many tutoring sites, such as [w3schools.com](https://w3schools.com/bootstrap). 

After cloning this repository, open your browser and start with the **index.html** page in the root directory. 

There is a template in each directory that has the basics for creating an HTML page. Use it as a starting point to create a new HTML page for the Bootstrap code you want to try/see.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As of this writing, the CDN calls are to **[Bootstrap v3.3.7](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/)** **[Bootstrap 4.0.0-beta.2](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/download/)** and **[Font Awesome 4.7.0](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/get-started/)** <br>
You do not need to install Bootstrap or Font Awesome if you decide to clone this repository. Each page has a call to the respective Content Delivery Network (CDN) as needed.

There are no lessons or anything here, just code I wanted to keep as a reference for myself.  If I play more I'll add those pages too just so they don't get lost.  

**Notes:** <br>
I originally created these pages on a MacBook Pro running OSX El Capitan (version 10.11.6)<br>
I checked the pages on the following browsers;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Chrome (version 62.0.3202.94)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Firefox (version 57.0)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Safari (version 11.0.1)<br>
I don't have a Windoze box handy but I may put these pages on a flash drive so I can see how they look with Exploder.  I don't anticipate any probs. (Note: Some Bootstrap calls are not supported in IE 9 and earlier)

### To-do
[x] Add code snippets to the pages so I don't have to continuously view the page source to see what I did to create the particular Bootstrap sample being displayed.<br>
[x] Decide which .container class to use:<br>
&nbsp; [ ]<code>.container</code> provides a responsive fixed width container<br>
&nbsp; [x]<code>.container-fluid</code> provides a full width container which spans the entire width of the viewport<br>
[ ] I added a page an accordian page in root that uses HTML and JavaScript.  Recreate with Bootstrap.  (Google is my friend.)<br>
