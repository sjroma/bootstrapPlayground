# My Bootstrap Playground

* After cloning this repository, open your browser and start with the index.html page in the root directory. 
* This is my sandbox for playing with/discovering Bootstrap. Feel free to do the same. Add pages, code something so you can see what it looks like. This is not meant to be instructional since everything here can be found by simply Googling whatever you're looking for. 
    * There is a template page in each directory that has the basics for creating an html page. Use it as a guide to create a new html page for the bootstrap code you want to try/see.
        * As of this writing, the CDN calls are to Bootstrap v3.3.7 and 4.0.0-beta.2 respectively and Font Awesome 4.7.0
* You do not need to install Bootstrap or Font Awesome if you decide to clone this repository. Each page has a call to the respective Content Delivery Network (CDN) as needed.
* I've started adding code snippets to the pages so I don't have to continuously view page source to see what I did to create the particular Bootstrap sample being displayed.
* As an afterthought, maybe this should have been called a sandbox
* There are no lessons or anything here, just code I wanted to keep as a reference for myself.  If I play more I'll add those pages too just so they don't get lost.  
   I did a page that has accordians using just HTML and JavaScript.  That will more than likely be the next thing I do with Bootstrap.  (Google is my friend.) 

**Notes:**
* I originally created these pages on a Mac running OSX El Capitan (version 10.11.6)
    * I checked the pages on the following browsers;
        * Chrome (version 62.0.3202.94)
        * Firefox (version 57.0)
        * Safari (version 11.0.1)
      
I don't have a Windoze box handy but I may put these pages on a flash drive so I can see how they look with Exploder.  I don't anticipate any probs.
